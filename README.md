### Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational techniques that present a mathematical model mathematical model inspired by the structure of a human brain, aiming to abstractly in an abstract way the nervous system in the learning process. The nervous system in turn, houses a complex set of cells, the neurons. The human brain holds billions of neurons, capable of processing and communicating with thousands more in a continuous and parallel fashion. A
communication between them is subdivided into three parts.

The cell body processes information and generates nerve impulses called synapses, which are located in the contact region between one neuron and another. The input regions are defined by the dendrites, receiving information the information (synapses) coming from other neurons, conducting them to the cell body. O Axon is the output set and is in charge of transmitting to the dendrites of other neurons the impulses generated by the cell body.

From the analogy of the biological neural network described, we can define a pre-established for an artificial neural network, consisting of input connections designated to receive initial information designated to receive initial information, as well as the linear combiner that develop the role of synapses the role of synapses and will be treated as the weights generating the activation potential, and finally a function that evaluates the activation potential and determines the output calculation of the neuron.
